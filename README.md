# Nbodypps

N-body code based on MERCURY6 by John Chambers written in Fortran90 used to investigate the growth of planetary embryos when including planetary migration and pebble accretion effects. Also includes a Python script that allows for comparison with an analytical disk model based on Liu (2015) and Gauard & Lin (2007).
